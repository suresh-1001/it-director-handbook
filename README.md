# IT Director’s Handbook

Living playbooks for running a modern IT/TechOps org: incident response, budgeting, roadmaps, hiring & growth, and vendor management (RFPs). Designed for fintech/regulated teams (PCI DSS / SOC 2), but generalizable to any company.

## What’s inside
- **Incident Response** – severity matrix, on-call runbook, RCA template.
- **Budgeting** – OpEx/CapEx model, planning cadence, download-ready CSV.
- **Roadmaps** – quarterly template and KPI dashboard menu.
- **Team Management** – onboarding, 1:1s, and IC/Lead career ladder.
- **RFPs** – repeatable vendor template + scorecard.

> Opinionated defaults: automation-first, least privilege, self-service, and audit-ready docs.
